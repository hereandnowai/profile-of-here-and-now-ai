### **Section 1: The Philosophy & The Problem (Slides 1-4)**

#### **Slide 1: Title Card**
*   **Main Title:** Full-Stack AI Program
*   **Sub-Title:** From "Hello World" to "Autonomous AI Systems"
*   **Presented By:** HERE AND NOW AI – Artificial Intelligence Research Institute
*   **Tagline:** Don’t just learn code. Architect Intelligence.

#### **Slide 2: The "Tutorial Hell" Reality**
*   **Visual:** A messy mind-map showing 50 different logos (AWS, React, C++, SQL) connected chaotically.
*   **Text:**
    *   **The Struggle:** Learning to code is hard. Most fail because the landscape is noisy and conflicting.
    *   **The Trap:** Spending months on theoretical "fluff" without building anything real.
    *   **The Gap:** Web Developers don't know AI. AI Engineers can't build Web Apps.

#### **Slide 3: Our Solution – The "Active Learner" Roadmap**
*   **Visual:** A straight, glowing path cutting through the chaos.
*   **Text:**
    *   **One Goal:** Streamlined, step-by-step guidance.
    *   **One Rule:** No fluff. Everything you learn is immediately applied.
    *   **The Output:** A Portfolio of Full-Stack GenAI Applications, not just certificates.

#### **Slide 4: Why Full Stack + GenAI?**
*   **Visual:** A standard web app icon merging with a Brain icon.
*   **Text:**
    *   **The Evolution:** A static website is yesterday's news. Today, applications must *think*.
    *   **The Integration:** You need **Frontend skills** to give AI a face, **Backend skills** to give it memory, and **AI models** to give it intelligence.
    *   **We teach you all three.**
