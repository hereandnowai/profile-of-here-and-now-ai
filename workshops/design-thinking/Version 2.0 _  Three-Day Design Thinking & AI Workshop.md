# **Workshop: Design Thinking for AI Innovation**

**Presented by:** HERE AND NOW AI

---

## **Module 1: The Design Mindset for Engineers**

**Objective:** Establishing the "Problem-First" approach before diving into code.

* **Introduction to HERE AND NOW AI**  
  * Institute Overview & Mission.  
  * The intersection of Human-Centric Design and Artificial Intelligence.  
* **Engineering vs. Design Thinking**  
  * Traditional Engineering: Executing specifications.  
  * Design Thinking: Discovering the right specifications.  
  * The risks of building solutions looking for a problem.  
* **The Double Diamond Framework**  
  * Understanding the flow: Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver.  
  * **Divergent Thinking:** creating choices and exploring possibilities.  
  * **Convergent Thinking:** Making choices and narrowing focus.  
* **Collaborative Dynamics (Icebreaker Activities)**  
  * Building psychological safety within technical teams.  
  * Demonstrating how non-technical life experiences influence product design.  
* **Rapid Communication (Sketching Exercise)**  
  * Overcoming the fear of imperfect drawing.  
  * Proving that low-fidelity sketches communicate concepts faster than code.

## **Module 2: Empathy & User Research**

**Objective:** Understanding the human user behind the screen.

* **The User Persona**  
  * Defining the target audience beyond simple data points.  
  * Creating a specific character profile: Role, technical literacy, environment, and goals.  
* **Mapping the User Experience**  
  * **The Empathy Map Framework:** Analyzing the persona through four quadrants (Says, Thinks, Does, Feels).  
  * **Identifying Pains:** Frustrations, roadblocks, fears, and inefficiencies.  
  * **Identifying Gains:** Hopes, needs, and measures of success.  
  * "Together Alone" collaboration method (individual generation vs. group discussion).

## **Module 3: Defining the Challenge**

**Objective:** Scoping the exact problem to be solved with AI.

* **Synthesizing Research into Insights**  
  * Translating raw user data into actionable design criteria.  
* **The Point of View (POV) Statement**  
  * Framing the narrative: *\[User\] needs \[Need\] because \[Insight\].*  
* **"How Might We" (HMW) Questions**  
  * Transforming negative pain points into positive opportunities for innovation.  
  * Ensuring the problem scope is actionable (not too broad, not too narrow).  
* **The Solution Scope (Decision Making)**  
  * Heatmap voting strategies to align the team.  
  * Selecting the critical "How Might We" challenge to solve in the next phase.

## **Module 4: Ideation & Concept Generation**

**Objective:** Rapidly generating multiple solutions before committing to code.

* **Divergent Ideation Strategies**  
  * Moving beyond the "first obvious idea."  
  * Techniques to force volume and variety in idea generation.  
* **Rapid Sketching (Crazy 8s)**  
  * Sketching multiple distinct interface or workflow variations in a compressed timeframe.  
* **Solution Storyboarding**  
  * Selecting the strongest concept.  
  * Creating a three-step storyboard: *The Trigger, The AI Interaction, The Benefit.*  
  * Reviewing and critiquing the logic before development begins.

## **Module 5: AI Prototyping & Architecture**

**Objective:** Transforming sketches into functional software.

* **AI as a Design Material**  
  * Understanding the capabilities and limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agents.  
  * Overview of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines and autonomous agent workflows.  
* **The "Wizard of Oz" Strategy**  
  * Prioritizing the user experience over backend perfection.  
  * Techniques for mocking up complex functionality for rapid testing.  
* **The Technology Stack**  
  * Overview of the selected tools for the build (e.g., Python frameworks, Streamlit, Gradio, or Low-Code platforms).  
  * Introduction to AI Templates provided by HERE AND NOW AI.  
* **The Build Sprint (Hackathon Mode)**  
  * **Track A: Prompt Engineering:** Defining the System Personality, context windows, and guardrails.  
  * **Track B: Interface Design:** Building the front-end user flow.  
  * Integration: Connecting the logic to the interface.

## **Module 6: Testing, Refinement & Delivery**

**Objective:** Validating the solution and telling the product story.

* **Validation Methodologies**  
  * How to conduct user tests without bias.  
  * Observational techniques: Watching what users do, not just what they say.  
* **Peer Testing Simulation**  
  * Conducting live runs of the prototype with users outside the development team.  
  * Collecting data on bugs, confusion, and "Aha\!" moments.  
* **The Feedback Grid**  
  * Structured analysis of testing results: *Likes, Criticisms, Questions, Ideas.*  
* **Iterative Engineering**  
  * Refining the AI prompts based on test results.  
  * Improving UI/UX friction points.  
* **Storytelling for Engineers**  
  * Structuring a Product Pitch: Problem → Solution → Demo → Value.  
* **Final Showcase & Evaluation**  
  * Live demonstration of the AI prototypes.  
  * Assessment based on Innovation, Feasibility, and User-Centricity.
